Migration
=========

Here are listed the manual actions you need to take before and after upgrading
a database from another series.

.. note::
   If you skip a series, all actions between them must be performed.

7.4
---

Before
~~~~~~

* If ``product_price_list`` and ``product_price_list_dates`` are activated,
  remove ``open_lines`` button:

  .. code-block:: SQL

     DELETE FROM "ir_model_button" WHERE "name" = 'open_lines' AND "model" = 'product.price_list';

7.2
---

Before
~~~~~~

* Use NULL value for empty foreign key with:

  .. code-block:: SQL

     UPDATE "ir_ui_view" SET "model" = NULL WHERE "model" = '';
     UPDATE "ir_action_act_window" SET "res_model" = NULL WHERE "res_model" = '';
     UPDATE "ir_action_wizard" SET "model" = NULL WHERE "model" = '';
     UPDATE "ir_action_report" SET "model" = NULL WHERE "model" = '';
     UPDATE "ir_action_report" SET "module" = NULL WHERE "module" = '';
     UPDATE "ir_translation" SET "module" = NULL WHERE "module" = '';

7.0
---

Before
~~~~~~

* If ``account_payment`` module is activated, remove ``account`` if ``line`` is
  set:

  .. code-block:: SQL

     UPDATE "account_payment" SET "account" = NULL WHERE "line" IS NOT NULL;

After
~~~~~

* If ``account_invoice`` module is activated, fill the amount caches with the
  ``trytond-console``:

  .. code-block:: python

     Invoice = pool.get('account.invoice')
     invoices = Invoice.search([('state', 'in', ['posted', 'paid'])])
     for invoice in invoices:
         invoice.untaxed_amount_cache = invoice.untaxed_amount
         invoice.tax_amount_cache = invoice.tax_amount
         invoice.total_amount_cache = invoice.total_amount

     Invoice.save(invoices)
     transaction.commit()

  .. note::

     This process may take some time depending on the number of invoices on
     your database.

* If ``product_price_list`` module is activated, add a default price list line
  if price list does not have one and it was relying on the fallback price.
