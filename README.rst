Setup
=====

It is recommended to isolate the development within a Python `virtual
environment <https://docs.python.org/tutorial/venv.html>`_.

From the root directory of the repository run:

.. code-block:: console

   .hooks/update_requirements
   .hooks/link_modules

.. warning::

   The process of updating requirements files may take some time.

Install the dependencies with:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install -e trytond -e tryton -e proteus -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt

Automate
========

To automate the process, add the following lines to the ``[hooks]`` section of
the ``.hg/hgrc``:

.. code-block:: ini

   [hooks]
   update.modules = .hooks/link_modules
   update.requirements = .hooks/update_requirements

On ``hg update``, the first hook will automatically create symlinks for modules
and the second hook will automatically generate requirements files.
